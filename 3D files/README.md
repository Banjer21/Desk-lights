# Discription

All parts should be printed ones, except for the arm and Cap, these need to be printed twice.
The front might need to be sanded slightly, to fit the lens properly.

There are two versions of the front, one with the possibility to add a diffuser, and one without. If you want no diffuser, you also do not need to print the FilmHolder.
